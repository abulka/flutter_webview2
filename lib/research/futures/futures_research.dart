/* 
  Pure futures, building your own async functions that return futures
  Run: dart lib/research/futures/futures_research.dart

  Lessons learned:

  An async method has to be declared to return a Future but actually returns
  the thing you are returning e.g. String which makes the caller simply do
    String s = await f()

  You can call a future without awaiting - it runs ok
  but the return value will be lost
  
  You can declare a variable and await a variable instead e.g.
    Future<String> futureString = f()
    String s = await futureString;

  Its like the 'await' converts from the Future type to actual thing type.

  You don't have to yield in a future e.g. yield i++; that's for streams
  where you are returning multiple values, like a generator.  In those cases
  we do weird things like declare 'async*' instead of just 'async'?

void main() async {

  // All the following use async, which still runs the counters in the same
  // thread thus doesn't help with counting to 1 billion.

  Future<String> futureString = fetchUserOrder();
  String s = await futureString;
  print(s);

  // or just
  s = await fetchUserOrder();
  print(s);

  // how simple is this
  s = await simple();
  print(s);

  // you can call a future without awaiting - it runs ok
  // but the return value will be lost
  playHideAndSeek2();
  playHideAndSeek3();

  // let's call my own home grown delay future...
  s = await playHideAndSeekTheLongVersion();
  print(s);

}

Future<String> fetchUserOrder() =>
    // why no async on this function?
    Future.delayed(
      Duration(seconds: 1),
      () => 'Large Latte',
    );

/// Make my own future function.
/// Looks like I can return a regular String from a function
/// declared to return a Future<String>

Future<String> simple() async {
  return 'simple blah';
}

/// You don't have to yield in a future - that's for streams
/// where you are returning multiple values, like a generator.
Future<String> playHideAndSeekTheLongVersion() async {
  var counting = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    counting = i;
  }
  return '$counting! Ready or not, here I come!';
}

Future<String> playHideAndSeek2() async {
  var counting = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i <= 20000000; i++) {
    counting = i;
  }
  print('playHideAndSeek2 $counting! Ready or not, here I come!');
  return '$counting! Ready or not, here I come!';
}

/// This returns nothing (void)
Future<void> playHideAndSeek3() async {
  var counting = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i <= 30000000; i++) {
    counting = i;

/*
 Official Interview question answer: It blocks your app because counting to ten
 billion is a computationally expensive task, even for a computer. Dart code
 runs inside its own area of memory called an isolate â€” also known as memory
 thread. Each isolate has its own memory heap, which ensures that no isolate can
 access any other isolate's state.

 Making it an async function wouldn't help, either, because it would still run
 on the same isolate.
