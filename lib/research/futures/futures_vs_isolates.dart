// Official Interview question answer:

/*
 Official Interview question answer: It blocks your app because counting to ten
 billion is a computationally expensive task, even for a computer. Dart code
 runs inside its own area of memory called an isolate â€” also known as memory
 thread. Each isolate has its own memory heap, which ensures that no isolate can
 access any other isolate's state.

 Making it an async function wouldn't help, either, because it would still run
 on the same isolate.

 OFFICIAL ANSWER is so simple - but uses the magical compute() function 
 (requires import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';)
 which requires flutter - cannot run this as pure dart.
